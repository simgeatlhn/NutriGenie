In recent years, rapid advancements in artificial intelligence have significantly impacted various industries. The NutriGenie project leverages these developments to create a mobile application designed to help users discover recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand. Developed using SwiftUI, the application employs a real-time camera recognition system to identify fruits and vegetables and uses machine learning technologies, particularly CoreML and Vision frameworks, to classify these ingredients. The user interface, developed with SwiftUI, provides a seamless user experience. NutriGenie integrates modern technologies to offer a unique and effective solution for recipe management, facilitating the creative use of available ingredients and promoting healthier eating habits.
